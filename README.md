# tale_of_an_arts_major
Game made for ludum dare with [@gegy1000](https://github.com/gegy1000)

In this silly game you play as a failed arts major who cannot paint well enough to earn a living. Thus, you must turn to a life of crime to sustain yourself. You will break into the Louvre, sneak past the guards, find a painting, steal it, and quickly replace it with a replica that you must paint yourself. Good luck.

Arrow keys to move, press C when over easel to paint.
Nothing past replicating the painting works, we ran out of time. Sorry!

To build from source you will need the sdl development libraries (follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) and the latest rust nightly. Run cargo build in the directory and you should be good to go.
